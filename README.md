# intro-to-git

This guide is meant to give you a quick introduction to the 4four steps of saving your work and pushing it up into your GitHub repo.  the four git commands we'll be covering are:

1. git status
2. git add .
3. git commit -m " "
4. git push

## git status

You would start with a *git status* this command shows us what files were changed in red and if it is already added, then the color of the text will be green.



## git add .

The next step is *git add .* remember the space in between the add and . this command prepares our work to be committed

## git commit -m ""

After, we use the command *git commit -m " "* This command saves our updated work.  When we save it to GitHub, we can give it a message with *-m " "* that can help remind us or other people what we have changed in our files.  

## git push 

Lastly, is the command *git push* this command is what we use to "push" up our work to GitHub, this will update up our work between what we have done on our own computers and what we have saved on GitHub.

## Reminder

Remember that you _must_ be inside of the correct project/folder inside of your terminal/bash.  If you want to update a project, remember that your terminal _must_ say mingw64~/desktop/webdev/*name of your project* and we can do this by using the command *cd* and then the name of where you want to go!
